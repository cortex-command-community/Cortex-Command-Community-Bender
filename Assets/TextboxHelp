--- GUI

LOAD:
This loads an image file and starts bending. 
Supported formats are bmp, png and jpg.

- Note:
The loaded file is being cut to 24x24px tiles internally. 
For best results, use provided template to create correct input files.


SAVE:
This saves the bended limbs into a file or creates a new file with specified name.

- Note:
Files are saved in .png format, typing in the extension is not needed. 
Currently loaded file cannot be overwritten.


--- ADJUSTING JOINTS

To adjust the joint positing on a limb part, click the upper joint marker on and drag it up/down, or click at desired point to set it there. 
Output will update automatically as you adjust the markers.

- Note:
Joint markers cannot be adjusted on the X axis, and will adjust equally on the Y axis. 
For best results, please position the limb parts as close to dead center as possible for each tile in the input file.


--- SETTINGS

ZOOM:
This magnifies the source image For easier placement of joint markers. 
Zooming does Not magnify the output.
Accepts values from 1 To 4.

- Warning:
Changing zoom level will reset the joint markers to initial positions. 
Zoom first, adjust markers later.


FRAMES:
This sets the amount of frames output will generate.
Accepts values from 1 to 20.

- Note :
Limb bending will automatically adjust to number of frames.


BG COLOR R,G,B:
This changes the background color of the output.
Accepts values from 0 to 255.
	
- Note :
When saving file, the output will automatically set background to magenta, so no manual setting before saving is needed.


SAVE AS INDEXED BITMAP:
When ticked the output will be saved as a BMP file indexed to the CC palette.
When not ticked, output will be saved as a non-indexed PNG.

- Warning :
THE INDEXING PROCESS IS SLOW!
I've done my best to speed it up but it still isn't blazing fast like PNG saving.
When saving indexed, the app may hang and appear unresponsive but in fact it's doing what it's supposed to.
For best results, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING until the background color reverts from magenta to whatever it was before!


SAVE AS FRAMES:
When ticked each frame of the output will be exported as an individual file.
Exported frame size is fixed to 24x24px. A bounding box will be shown around each frame to help user stay within bounds.
Anything outside bounds will be cropped.

Does not conflict with "SAVE AS INDEXED BITMAP" and can be used together to export indexed individual frames.

- Quadruple Warning :
WHEN SAVING, DO NOT MANUALLY ADD LIMB NAME OR FRAME NUMBER TO FILE NAME. THIS IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY.
DOING SO WILL RESULT IS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPORTED FILE NAMES.
