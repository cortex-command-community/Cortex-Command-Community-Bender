Basic Controls:
    • Load
      Loads an image file and starts bending. Supported formats are BMP, PNG and JPG/JPEG. Files can also be loaded by dragging and dropping them into the main window.
      The loaded file is being cut to 24x24px tiles internally. A file that is not the correct dimensions will be rejected. For best results, use provided template to create correct input files.
																					
    • Save
      Saves the bended limbs into a new file (or multiple files if saving as frames) with the specified name. Typing the file extension is not needed. The currently loaded file cannot be overwritten.
																					
Editor Settings:
    • Background Color (R, G, B)
      Changes the background color of the output. When saving file, the output will automatically set background color to magenta (255, 0, 255) so no manual setting before saving is needed.  
																					
    • Input Zoom
      Magnifies the source image for easier placement of joint markers. Changing zoom level will reset the joint markers to initial positions.
      Does not magnify the output. Accepts values from 1 to a maximum value calculated from the desktop width.
																					
    • Output Zoom
      Magnifies the bend limb output for easier examination. Does not affect saved files, they will be saved at original dimensions. Accepts values from 1 to 5.
      When zoomed, the output area can be panned by clicking and dragging so all the output that does not fit the window can be examined.
																					
    • Frame Count
      Sets the amount of frames output will generate. Limb bending will automatically adjust to number of frames. Accepts values from 1 to 20.
																					
    • Save As Indexed
      Sets the output to be saved as an indexed color file indexed to the CC palette, otherwise the output will be saved as a non-indexed PNG.
      When ticked, a combobox with the available file formats will appear. The selected item in the box will be the one used for saving (PNG by default).
																					
    • Save As Frames
      Sets each frame in the output to be exported as an individual file. A bounding box will be shown around each frame to help user stay within bounds.
      The content within the bounds is then cropped to actual dimensions (all empty space will be trimmed).
      When saving as frames, do not manually add limb name or frame number to the file name! This is done automatically! DOING SO WILL RESULT IS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPORTED FILE NAMES!
																					
Adjusting Joints:
    • To adjust the joint positioning on a limb part, click the joint marker on and drag it, or click at desired point to set it there. Output will update automatically as you adjust the markers.
      Note that the lower joint marker only adjusts the length of the limb part, not it's position.
																					
Layering Controls:
    • Adjust the draw order of the limb parts in a limb by ticking the checkbox of that limb. Lower parts are drawn on top by default.
																					
Saving Settings as User Defaults:
    • The "Save Settings" button will save the current editor settings to a file. If this file exists, it will be automatically loaded on startup and apply the settings as defaults.
